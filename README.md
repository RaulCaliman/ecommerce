Phase 1: The Foundation (MySQL Schema Design)

Requirement 1.1: Create the Products(productid,name,price,stockcount), Customers, Orders, and Order_Items tables.
Requirement 1.2: Enforce Primary Keys for unique identification.
Requirement 1.3: Establish Foreign Key constraints so an order cannot be created for a user that does not exist.
Requirement 1.4: Set strictly typed columns (e.g., DECIMAL(10,2) for prices to avoid rounding errors, UNSIGNED INT for stock so it can never drop below zero).

Phase 2: The Inventory Drop (Data Seeding)

Requirement 2.1: Write an SQL script to insert 10 distinct products with varying stock levels and prices.
Requirement 2.2: Insert a few test customers.
Phase 3: The High-Speed Cart (Redis Integration)

Requirement 3.1: Connect the Node.js application to a local Redis instance.
Requirement 3.2: Write the logic to create a Redis HASH when a user adds an item (storing Product ID and Quantity).
Requirement 3.3: Implement a Time-To-Live (TTL) so the cart automatically deletes itself from memory after 24 hours of inactivity.

Phase 4: The Checkout Protocol (ACID Transactions)

Requirement 4.1: Write a Node.js function that opens a MySQL TRANSACTION.
Requirement 4.2: Use a SELECT ... FOR UPDATE query. This locks the specific product row so no other user can buy it while this transaction is processing.
Requirement 4.3: Check if StockCount >= RequestedQuantity. If true, deduct the stock and insert the new records into Orders and Order_Items.
Requirement 4.4: COMMIT the transaction if everything succeeds, or ROLLBACK if anything fails (e.g., insufficient stock).
Requirement 4.5: Clear the user's Redis cart upon a successful commit.

Phase 5: The Back-Office Analytics (Complex SQL)

Requirement 5.1: Write a JOIN query to calculate the total revenue generated by a specific customer.
Requirement 5.2: Write an aggregation query (GROUP BY) to find the top 3 best-selling products.
Requirement 5.3: Write a query to flag any products where the stock count has dropped below 5.

Phase 6: The API Bridge (Node.js & Express)

Requirement 6.1: Install a web framework to create a server.
Requirement 6.2: Create a GET /api/products route. This will run your SELECT * FROM Products query and send the raw JSON data to the frontend.
Requirement 6.3: Create a POST /api/cart route. This will take the user's click and send it to your Redis database.
Requirement 6.4: Create a POST /api/checkout route. This will trigger your ACID transaction script in PostgreSQL.
